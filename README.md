I've created this Interactive Dashboard on Excel using a sample business dataset, which allows you to instantly modify, the visual appearance of your dashboard as well filter slicers according to data required by the User. 



Every slicer is connected to all the dashboard charts, the filtering functions of these slices work perfectly together and you are able to either select only one value dimension or if you want to you can also do a multi-select or filter values. 



You can choose between different gradient color themes, using these radio buttons simply beautiful and with these modern taco buttons, you can either enable or disable certain elements and functionalities in your dashboard, like the Info Button functionality in the tiles, or change dashboard theme colors.



Everything is possible with this basic interactive Excel dashboard and just, as a recap, what makes this dashboard, really powerful? It all off. And with a slices at the bottom, you can filter your underlying data from basically any angle. So for example, we can filter our dashboard shots by single years, All we can even apply multi-select so that multiple years can be selected. Is that all these slices down there are working together. last of all, we have this beautiful and progressive design in every single element of this dashboard.
